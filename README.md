I ❤ gardening, DIY, and talking to good people (BTW, I can do it in English, Spanish, and "a-bit-broken" French, lol!).

👨🏻‍💻 I work at [Grada](https://grada.cc)—a team of several like-minded people that I created together with my lovely wife!

I am a complete 🤓 when it comes to **automating corporate processes** with:

    Excel       designing and implementing sales dashboards, 
                and custom tools that help speed up time-consuming tasks
                by programming in VBA.
                
    Word        enhancing poorly designed documents and creating templates 
                that help people to easily create great business letters, 
                reports, and even books.
                
    Access      developing custom applications that are used on a daily basis
                in the business world integrating it with third-party platforms
                using different protocols and technologies.
    
    Outlook     creating templates for newsletters, and corporate signatures
                and creating automatic workflows that are triggered after
                receiving an email.
    
    PowerPoint  either by "beautifying" presentations or creating templates 
                that help non-designers create slides that match a corporate identity.
